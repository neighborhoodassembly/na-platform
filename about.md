## About Neighborhood Assembly

Neighborhood Assembly is a platform designed to help local communities make decisions together in a secure and transparent way

The platform allows neighborhood groups housing associations and civic organizations to:
- Create online votes on budget changes safety improvements community rules and more
- Start discussion groups to build consensus before making decisions
- Invite all residents to participate regardless of their technical skills
- Keep track of past decisions and community input

We believe that every voice matters and that technology should help communities become stronger more inclusive and more connected
